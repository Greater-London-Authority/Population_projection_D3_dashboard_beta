# Belly Button Biodiversity challenge (in progress)
In this project, I will be building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset using the D3 library. The dashboard will feature a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and a display of sample metadata. The goal is to update all the plots and the metadata when a new sample is selected.
